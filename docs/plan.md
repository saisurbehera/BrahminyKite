# BrahminyKite Ideal Verifier - Design Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the design plan for implementing an ideal verifier system based on the philosophical foundations described in `philophicalbasis.md`. The system integrates multiple philosophical frameworks to handle verification across both objective and subjective domains.

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Multi-Framework Integration
- **No Single Truth Source**: Avoid relying on any single verification framework
- **Contextual Adaptation**: Apply different frameworks based on domain appropriateness
- **Transparent Trade-offs**: Expose conflicts between frameworks rather than hiding them
- **Value Pluralism**: Acknowledge irreducible conflicts between competing values

### 2. Philosophical Framework Support
| Framework | Primary Use Cases | Implementation |
|-----------|------------------|----------------|
| Positivist | Empirical claims, scientific data | Rule-based systems, data validation |
| Interpretivist | Cultural context, meaning analysis | NLP models, knowledge graphs |
| Pragmatist | Practical outcomes, utility | Simulation, RL optimization |
| Correspondence | Objective reality matching | Sensor data, database queries |
| Coherence | Internal consistency | SAT solvers, logic validators |
| Constructivist | Power dynamics, bias analysis | Network analysis, bias detection |

## System Architecture

### Component Layer (A-F from philophicalbasis.md)

#### A. Empirical Verifier
- **Purpose**: Handle objective, measurable claims
- **Methods**: 
  - Sensor data integration
  - Database cross-referencing
  - Mathematical proof validation
  - Symbolic reasoning (Prolog-style)
- **Frameworks**: Positivist, Correspondence
- **Example**: "Earth orbits Sun" → astronomical data validation

#### B. Contextual Verifier  
- **Purpose**: Understand semantic and cultural context
- **Methods**:
  - NLP embeddings (BERT, transformers)
  - Knowledge graph analysis (Wikidata)
  - Cultural framework mapping
  - Historical context processing
- **Frameworks**: Interpretivist, Constructivist
- **Example**: "Poem captures longing" → semantic analysis + cultural context

#### C. Consistency Verifier
- **Purpose**: Check logical and systemic coherence
- **Methods**:
  - SAT solver integration
  - Graph consistency algorithms
  - Legal/ethical system alignment
  - Internal logic validation
- **Frameworks**: Coherence
- **Example**: Legal argument → precedent alignment + logical structure

#### D. Power Dynamics Verifier
- **Purpose**: Analyze authority, bias, and power structures
- **Methods**:
  - Source credibility scoring
  - Bias detection ML models
  - Information flow network analysis
  - Authority hierarchy mapping
- **Frameworks**: Constructivist
- **Example**: News claim → source authority + bias detection

#### E. Utility Verifier
- **Purpose**: Assess practical effectiveness and outcomes
- **Methods**:
  - Monte Carlo simulations
  - Reinforcement learning optimization
  - Real-world outcome tracking
  - Cost-benefit analysis
- **Frameworks**: Pragmatist
- **Example**: Policy proposal → simulation of outcomes

#### F. Evolutionary Verifier
- **Purpose**: Adaptive learning and self-improvement
- **Methods**:
  - Performance tracking
  - Rule adaptation algorithms
  - Confidence modeling
  - Feedback integration
- **Frameworks**: Pragmatist (learning-focused)
- **Example**: Update verification rules based on success/failure patterns

### Meta-Verification Layer

#### Conflict Resolution System
- **Pareto Optimization**: Find solutions that balance competing criteria
- **Domain Weighting**: Apply framework weights based on claim domain
- **Reflective Equilibrium**: Iteratively adjust between principles and judgments
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Provide confidence intervals for decisions

#### Framework Arbitration Rules
```
Domain.EMPIRICAL → Weight(Positivist: 1.0, Correspondence: 0.9, Pragmatist: 0.7)
Domain.AESTHETIC → Weight(Interpretivist: 1.0, Constructivist: 0.9, Coherence: 0.7)  
Domain.ETHICAL → Weight(Coherence: 1.0, Pragmatist: 0.8, Constructivist: 0.7)
```

### Debate System Layer

#### Adversarial Verification
- **Multi-Agent Debate**: Different agents represent philosophical stances
- **Critique Generation**: Each framework critiques others' assessments
- **Consensus Measurement**: Calculate agreement/disagreement levels
- **Winner Selection**: Based on argument strength and evidence quality

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Philosophical Pitfalls
1. **Single Framework Dominance**: Never let one framework override all others
2. **Universal Truth Claims**: Acknowledge domain-specific verification standards
3. **Bias Blindness**: Always check for power dynamics and institutional bias
4. **Gaming Prevention**: Avoid surface-level criteria satisfaction
5. **Static Rules**: Enable adaptation and learning from feedback

### Technical Pitfalls
1. **Reward Hacking**: Prevent optimization of proxies instead of true objectives
2. **Instrumental Convergence**: Avoid systems gaming verification metrics
3. **Value Lock-in**: Prevent permanent bias toward initial framework weights
4. **Brittleness**: Handle edge cases and novel domains gracefully

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Components
- [x] Implement six verification components (A-F)
- [x] Create basic framework integration
- [x] Add domain-specific weighting
- [x] Build meta-verification conflict resolution

### Phase 2: Advanced Features
- [x] Adversarial debate system
- [x] Parallel processing capability
- [x] Uncertainty quantification
- [x] Adaptive learning mechanisms

### Phase 3: Real-World Integration
- [ ] Connect to actual data sources (APIs, databases, sensors)
- [ ] Implement proper NLP models (BERT, knowledge graphs)
- [ ] Add real SAT solvers and logic systems
- [ ] Create human-in-the-loop feedback systems

### Phase 4: Evaluation & Refinement
- [ ] Test on diverse claim types
- [ ] Measure philosophical consistency
- [ ] Validate against human expert judgment
- [ ] Optimize for computational efficiency

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Modularity
- Each verification component is independent
- Components can be swapped/upgraded individually
- New frameworks can be added without system redesign

### 2. Transparency
- All verification steps are logged and explainable
- Conflicts between frameworks are explicitly shown
- Uncertainty levels are always reported

### 3. Adaptability
- System learns from feedback and adjusts weights
- New domains can be accommodated with minimal changes
- Verification rules evolve based on performance

### 4. Robustness
- Multiple frameworks provide redundancy
- Parallel processing prevents single points of failure
- Confidence intervals acknowledge uncertainty

## Success Criteria

### Philosophical Alignment
- ✅ Integrates multiple epistemological frameworks
- ✅ Handles both objective and subjective domains
- ✅ Acknowledges value pluralism and moral uncertainty
- ✅ Implements reflective equilibrium principles
