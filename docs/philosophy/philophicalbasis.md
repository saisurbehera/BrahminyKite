# Philosophical basis of truth

> Correspondence theory says truth matches reality, but in subjective fields, reality isn't as clear. Coherence theory might be more relevant here, where truth is about internal consistency. Pragmatism could also come into play, focusing on practical outcomes rather than absolute truth.


Philosophers have long debated the nature of verification, particularly in non-STEM fields where objectivity is elusive. These debates intersect with epistemology, ethics, philosophy of science, and social theory. Let us try to think about how an ideal verifier would work.

Below is a synthesis of key philosophical arguments and frameworks relevant to verification in subjective or ambiguous domains:

## Epistemological Debates: What Counts as Verification?

Positivism vs. Interpretivism

* **Positivism** (e.g., Auguste Comte, logical positivists like Carnap):
    * Argues that verification requires empirical, objective evidence. In non-STEM fields, this stance struggles with subjectivity, leading to skepticism about claims that lack "hard" data (e.g., art criticism or ethics).
    * Critique: Reductionist; fails to account for meaning in human experiences (e.g., Weber’s verstehen).
* **Interpretivism** (e.g., Max Weber, Clifford Geertz)
    * Verification involves understanding context, intentions, and cultural frameworks. For example, verifying a historical narrative requires interpreting motives and social structures, not just facts.
    * Critique: Risks relativism—how do we arbitrate between conflicting interpretations?
* **Pragmatism** (e.g., Peirce, Dewey, Rorty):
    * Verification is about practical consequences rather than absolute truth. A policy proposal is "verified" if it solves a problem, even if its theoretical underpinnings are contested.

An **ideal verfifer** will try to:
* Integrate multiple forms of evidence and modes of understanding. For instance, when evaluating a historical claim, they should consider both empirical evidence (archaeological findings, primary documents) and interpretive analysis (cultural context, comparative studies).
* Acknowledge the strengths and limitations of different verification methods. Some questions are better suited to positivist approaches (measuring physical phenomena), while others require interpretive frameworks (understanding social movements).
* Consider practical implications while maintaining theoretical rigor. Following the pragmatist tradition, verification should balance abstract truth claims with real-world applications.
* Recognize that verification standards may vary by domain. What counts as verification in physics may differ from verification in anthropology or ethics.

## Correspondence vs. Coherence Theories:
* **Correspondence** (Aristotle, Bertrand Russell):
    * Truth aligns with objective reality. In subjective domains, this raises questions: What "reality" does a poem or ethical claim correspond to?
    * Limitation: Falters when reality is socially constructed (e.g., religion).

* **Coherence** (Hegel, Brand Blanshard):
    * Truth depends on internal consistency within a system of beliefs. For example, a legal argument is verified if it coheres with precedent and principles.
    * Critique: A coherent system can still be wrong (e.g., Ptolemaic astronomy).

* **Constructivism** (e.g., Foucault, Kuhn):
    * Truth and verification are shaped by power structures ("regimes of truth") or paradigms. In art, what counts as "good" is validated by institutions (museums, critics).

Example: The canonization of certain authors in literature reflects cultural power, not inherent quality.

An **ideal verifier** in this case will:

* Recognize that correspondence and coherence often complement rather than contradict each other
* Apply different verification standards contextually
* Understand that verification often requires multiple levels of analysis
* Be aware of potential verification traps
* Consider the role of pragmatic success

## Verification in Aesthetic and Creative Domains

* **Aesthetic Judgment**
    * Verification involves subjective universality—we judge art as if its beauty should hold for everyone, yet it resists objective proof.

* **Postmodern Critique** (Lyotard, Baudrillard):
    * Rejects grand narratives of verification. In art or literature, meaning is fragmented and hyperreal (e.g., Baudrillard’s simulacra). Verification becomes a paradox in a world of copies without originals.

An **ideal verifiers** will:
* Reject grand narratives, it would acknowledge multiple, coexisting interpretations without privileging a single "truth." Verification becomes a process of mapping diverse meanings, reflecting Baudrillard’s simulacra by analyzing how works engage with copies, context, and cultural codes rather than originals.
* It would assess how aesthetic judgments resonate across communities, not through objective proof but via shared sensibilities.
* treating verification as an ongoing, participatory process rather than a fixed judgment

## LLM challenges

The core challenge lies in how a robot or AI system would resolve conflicts between competing verification frameworks (e.g., positivist empiricism vs. constructivist power analysis) when optimizing for automated rewards. When a robot optimizes for "automated rewards" derived from philosophical verification criteria, it faces three key issues:

* **Value Pluralism**: Different verification frameworks prioritize conflicting goals (e.g., empirical accuracy vs. ethical fairness).
* **Reward Specification**: Translating abstract philosophical ideals into computable reward functions (e.g., "justice" or "truth").
* **Instrumental Convergence**: The robot might "game" the system by satisfying surface-level criteria while violating deeper principles (e.g., fabricating data to satisfy positivist checks).

Ways to work on this: 
* **Multi-Objective Optimization**
    * Treat each verification framework as a separate objective (e.g., accuracy, fairness, coherence) and seek Pareto-optimal solutions.
* **Meta-Verification Rules**
    * Design a higher-order system to arbitrate between verification frameworks based on context.
        - Hierarchical reinforcement learning
* **Debate Systems**:
    * Use adversarial AI agents representing different philosophical stances to critique solutions iteratively.

* **Human in the loop**

Some of the ways, it needs to express its opinion is:
* **Value Pluralism** (Isaiah Berlin)
    * Insight: There is no single "correct" verification framework. Robots must balance irreducible conflicts (e.g., liberty vs. equality).
    * AI Implication: Systems should expose trade-offs transparently rather than optimize for a single dominant reward.

* **Moral Uncertainty** (William MacAskill)
    * Insight: When unsure which ethical theory is correct, act cautiously to avoid worst-case outcomes.
    * AI Implication: Use distributional robustness—optimize for policies that perform acceptably across all plausible verification frameworks.

* **Reflective Equilibrium** (John Rawls)
    * Insight: Balance abstract principles (e.g., fairness) with concrete judgments (e.g., case outcomes).
    * AI Implication: Iteratively adjust verification criteria to minimize dissonance between rules and intuitions.

An ideal system therefore will not:
* The LLM exploits loopholes in verification criteria
* Dominant verification frameworks and marginalize minority perspectives.
* Acknowledge that verification framework is universally "correct".

## Core Principles for Automation

To avoid building verifiers "one by one," focus on:

* **Generalization**: Create verifiers that adapt to new domains with minimal manual tweaking.
* **Compositionality**: Build verifiers from reusable components (e.g., logic modules, data validators).
* **Self-Improvement**: Use feedback loops to iteratively refine verifiers.
