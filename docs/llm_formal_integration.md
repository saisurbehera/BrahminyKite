# LLM + Formal Verification Integration

*How Large Language Models and Formal Logic Systems Work Together in Chil*

The Chil framework pioneers a novel integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with formal verification systems, combining the intuitive reasoning power of AI with the mathematical rigor of theorem provers.

## The Challenge

Traditional verification systems face a fundamental dilemma:

- **Formal systems** (Lean, Coq, Z3) provide mathematical guarantees but cannot understand natural language
- **LLMs** excel at natural language understanding but lack formal logical guarantees
- **Humans** reason in natural language but make logical errors

**Chil's Solution**: Use each system for what it does best, creating a synergistic pipeline that achieves both natural language understanding and formal logical rigor.

## Specific LLM Roles

### 1. Natural Language → Formal Logic Translation

The LLM acts as a sophisticated translator, converting human reasoning into formal logical representations.

**Example Input:**
```
"All ravens are black, but some birds are not black. 
This creates a logical tension if ravens are birds."
```

**LLM Analysis:**
```
Logical Structure Detected:
1. Universal statement: ∀x (Raven(x) → Black(x))
2. Existential statement: ∃x (Bird(x) ∧ ¬Black(x))  
3. Category relationship: ∀x (Raven(x) → Bird(x))
4. Potential contradiction between 1, 2, 3
```

**Generated Lean Code:**
```lean
-- LLM-generated formal representation
variable (Raven Bird : Type)
variable (Black : Bird → Prop)
variable (raven_is_bird : Raven → Bird)

-- All ravens are black
axiom ravens_black : ∀ (r : Raven), Black (raven_is_bird r)

-- Some birds are not black  
axiom some_birds_not_black : ∃ (b : Bird), ¬Black b

-- Check for contradiction
theorem consistency_check : ¬(∀ (r : Raven), Black (raven_is_bird r)) ∨ 
                           ¬(∃ (b : Bird), ¬Black b) ∨
                           ¬(∀ (r : Raven), Bird (raven_is_bird r)) := by
  -- This will help identify the logical tension
  sorry
```

**Translation Confidence:** 85% with assumptions clearly documented.

### 2. Multi-Step Reasoning Analysis

For complex arguments, the LLM breaks down reasoning into verifiable steps.

**Example: Climate Change Argument**
```
"If climate change causes sea level rise, and sea level rise threatens 
coastal cities, then climate change threatens coastal cities. However, 
technological adaptation might mitigate these threats."
```

**LLM Reasoning Breakdown:**
```yaml
reasoning_steps:
  - step_1: "Climate change causes sea level rise"
    type: "causal_premise"
    formal_representation: "ClimateChange → SeaLevelRise"
    
  - step_2: "Sea level rise threatens coastal cities"  
    type: "causal_premise"
    formal_representation: "SeaLevelRise → ThreatensCoastalCities"
    
  - step_3: "Therefore, climate change threatens coastal cities"
    type: "logical_conclusion"
    formal_representation: "ClimateChange → ThreatensCoastalCities"
    inference_rule: "modus_ponens_chain"
    
  - step_4: "Technological adaptation might mitigate threats"
    type: "qualifying_premise"
    formal_representation: "TechAdaptation → ¬ThreatensCoastalCities"
    logical_tension: "conflicts_with_step_3"

logical_structure:
  - main_argument: "Valid modus ponens chain (steps 1-3)"
  - complication: "Step 4 introduces conditional mitigation"
  - overall_assessment: "Logically valid but contains unresolved tension"
```

**Formal Verification for Each Step:**
```lean
-- Each step gets individually verified
theorem step_1_2_3_valid : 
  (ClimateChange → SeaLevelRise) → 
  (SeaLevelRise → ThreatensCoastalCities) → 
  (ClimateChange → ThreatensCoastalCities) := by
  intros h1 h2 h3
  exact h2 (h1 h3)  -- Valid by transitivity

-- The tension with step 4 is formally identified
theorem tension_with_mitigation :
  (ClimateChange → ThreatensCoastalCities) →
  (TechAdaptation → ¬ThreatensCoastalCities) →
  (ClimateChange ∧ TechAdaptation) → False := by
  -- This reveals the logical structure of the tension
  sorry
```

### 3. Proof Explanation & Interpretation

When formal systems produce results, LLMs translate them back to human-understandable explanations.

**Formal System Output:**
```
Z3 SMT Solver Result: UNSAT
Execution time: 0.03s
Core: [ravens_black, some_birds_not_black, ravens_are_birds]
```

**LLM Explanation:**
```
The SMT solver found the statements to be inconsistent (UNSAT). 

Key Insights:
• The combination of "all ravens are black" with "some birds are not black" 
  creates a logical contradiction when ravens are classified as birds
• The inconsistency is fundamental - it's not a matter of incomplete information
• The proof was found quickly (0.03s), indicating a direct logical conflict

Practical Implications:
• At least one of the three premises must be false or imprecise
• Either: (1) not all ravens are actually black, or (2) ravens are not birds 
  in the relevant sense, or (3) the "some birds" refers to non-raven birds
• This suggests the need for more precise definitions or acknowledgment of exceptions

Suggested Refinements:
• Qualify the raven statement: "Most ravens are black" or "Ravens are typically black"
• Specify the scope: "Some non-raven birds are not black"
• Define categories more precisely to avoid overlap issues
```

## Iterative Refinement Loop

The LLM-formal integration includes automatic refinement when initial translations fail verification.

```python
async def verify_with_refinement(claim: Claim) -> VerificationResult:
    """
    LLM-guided iterative refinement process
    """
    
    # Step 1: Initial LLM translation
    initial_translation = await llm.translate_to_formal(
        claim=claim.content,
        target_system=FormalSystem.LEAN,
        context=claim.context
    )
    
    # Step 2: Formal verification attempt
    proof_result = await lean.verify(initial_translation.formal_code)
    
    # Step 3: If inconsistent, initiate refinement
    if not proof_result.is_consistent:
        self.logger.info("Initial verification failed, starting refinement...")
        
        # LLM analyzes the failure
        failure_analysis = await llm.analyze_proof_failure(
            original_claim=claim.content,
            formal_translation=initial_translation.formal_code,
            error_message=proof_result.error_message,
            counterexample=proof_result.counterexample
        )
        
        # Generate refined translation
        refined_translation = await llm.refine_translation(
            original=claim,
            current_translation=initial_translation,
            issues_found=failure_analysis.issues,
            suggested_fixes=failure_analysis.suggestions
        )
        
        # Step 4: Re-verify refined version
        refined_result = await lean.verify(refined_translation.formal_code)
        
        # Combine insights from both attempts
        return self.combine_verification_attempts(
            original_attempt=(initial_translation, proof_result),
            refined_attempt=(refined_translation, refined_result),
            failure_analysis=failure_analysis
        )
    
    # Step 5: Success case - generate explanation
    explanation = await llm.explain_proof_success(
        claim=claim.content,
        formal_proof=proof_result,
        translation_reasoning=initial_translation.reasoning_steps
    )
    
    return VerificationResult(
        confidence_score=0.9,  # High confidence for successful formal proof
        reasoning=explanation.natural_language_summary,
        evidence_references=[f"Lean proof: {proof_result.proof_steps}"],
        formal_verification=True
    )
```

## Real-World Example: AI Safety Argument

**Input Claim:**
```
"If artificial intelligence surpasses human intelligence, and superintelligent 
AI is not aligned with human values, then humanity faces existential risk. 
Recent advances in large language models suggest AGI is approaching rapidly. 
Therefore, AI alignment research is critically urgent."
```

**LLM Analysis:**
```yaml
logical_structure:
  premise_1: "AI surpasses human intelligence → superintelligent AI exists"
  premise_2: "superintelligent AI ∧ ¬aligned → existential risk"  
  premise_3: "LLM advances → AGI approaching rapidly"
  premise_4: "AGI approaching → superintelligent AI soon"
  conclusion: "existential risk possible soon → alignment research urgent"

reasoning_type: "conditional_chain_with_empirical_premise"
argument_form: "modus_ponens_chain + normative_conclusion"

identified_assumptions:
  - "LLM advances are reliable indicators of AGI progress"
  - "AGI will lead to superintelligence"  
  - "Existential risk justifies research urgency"
  - "Current alignment techniques are insufficient"
```

**Formal Verification (Lean):**
```lean
-- LLM-generated formal representation
variable (AI_surpasses_human : Prop)
variable (superintelligent_AI : Prop) 
variable (aligned_with_values : Prop)
variable (existential_risk : Prop)
variable (LLM_advances : Prop)
variable (AGI_approaching : Prop)
variable (alignment_research_urgent : Prop)

-- Premises from the argument
axiom premise_1 : AI_surpasses_human → superintelligent_AI
axiom premise_2 : superintelligent_AI ∧ ¬aligned_with_values → existential_risk
axiom premise_3 : LLM_advances → AGI_approaching
axiom premise_4 : AGI_approaching → AI_surpasses_human
axiom premise_5 : existential_risk → alignment_research_urgent

-- Empirical claim
axiom current_observation : LLM_advances

-- Main theorem: the argument's conclusion follows from premises
theorem ai_safety_argument : alignment_research_urgent := by
  have h1 : AGI_approaching := premise_3 current_observation
  have h2 : AI_surpasses_human := premise_4 h1  
  have h3 : superintelligent_AI := premise_1 h2
  -- Note: We need the additional premise about alignment
  sorry -- This reveals the gap in the argument
```

**Formal Verification Result:**
```
Status: INCOMPLETE PROOF
Issue: Missing premise about AI alignment likelihood
Gap: The argument assumes superintelligent AI will be unaligned
```

**LLM Explanation:**
```
The formal verification reveals that while the logical structure is valid, 
the argument contains an implicit assumption that superintelligent AI will 
likely be unaligned with human values.

Logical Analysis:
✅ The conditional chain is formally valid (if premises are true, conclusion follows)
✅ The reasoning structure uses sound inference rules  
❌ Missing explicit premise about alignment probability

Strength: The argument's logical form is sound
Weakness: Relies on unstated assumption about default AI alignment

Refined Argument Needed:
"If AI surpasses human intelligence, and there's significant probability that 
superintelligent AI will not be aligned with human values (due to alignment 
difficulty), then humanity faces existential risk..."

This makes the alignment probability assumption explicit and verifiable.
```

## Integration Benefits for Consensus

In Chil's consensus mode, the LLM-formal integration provides additional advantages:

### Cross-Node Translation Consistency
```python
# Different nodes can verify the same formal translation
node_a_translation = await llm.translate_to_lean(claim)
node_b_translation = await llm.translate_to_lean(claim)

# Formal systems can verify translation equivalence
equivalence_proof = await lean.prove_equivalent(
    node_a_translation.formal_code,
    node_b_translation.formal_code
)

# This ensures nodes are reasoning about the same logical structure
```

### Distributed Proof Verification
```python
# Node A finds a proof
proof_a = await node_a.lean.prove(claim_translation)

# Node B can independently verify the proof
verification_b = await node_b.lean.verify_proof(proof_a)

# LLM can explain disagreements
if not verification_b.valid:
    explanation = await llm.explain_proof_disagreement(
        proof_a, verification_b.error_message
    )
```

### Philosophical Framework Integration
```python
# Each framework can contribute to formal verification
empirical_constraints = await empirical_framework.get_formal_constraints(claim)
contextual_constraints = await contextual_framework.get_formal_constraints(claim)

# LLM integrates constraints into unified formal representation
unified_formal_claim = await llm.integrate_framework_constraints(
    base_claim=claim,
    empirical_constraints=empirical_constraints,
    contextual_constraints=contextual_constraints,
    target_system=FormalSystem.LEAN
)

# Formal verification checks compatibility across frameworks
compatibility_result = await lean.verify_framework_compatibility(unified_formal_claim)
```
