# Philosophical basis of truth

> Correspondence theory says truth matches reality, but in subjective fields, reality isn't as clear. Coherence theory might be more relevant here, where truth is about internal consistency. Pragmatism could also come into play, focusing on practical outcomes rather than absolute truth.


Philosophers have long debated the nature of verification, particularly in non-STEM fields where objectivity is elusive. These debates intersect with epistemology, ethics, philosophy of science, and social theory. Let us try to think about how an ideal verifier would work.

Below is a synthesis of key philosophical arguments and frameworks relevant to verification in subjective or ambiguous domains:

## Epistemological Debates: What Counts as Verification?

Positivism vs. Interpretivism

* **Positivism** (e.g., Auguste Comte, logical positivists like Carnap):
    * Argues that verification requires empirical, objective evidence. In non-STEM fields, this stance struggles with subjectivity, leading to skepticism about claims that lack "hard" data (e.g., art criticism or ethics).
    * Critique: Reductionist; fails to account for meaning in human experiences (e.g., Weber’s verstehen).
* **Interpretivism** (e.g., Max Weber, Clifford Geertz)
    * Verification involves understanding context, intentions, and cultural frameworks. For example, verifying a historical narrative requires interpreting motives and social structures, not just facts.
    * Critique: Risks relativism—how do we arbitrate between conflicting interpretations?
* **Pragmatism** (e.g., Peirce, Dewey, Rorty):
    * Verification is about practical consequences rather than absolute truth. A policy proposal is "verified" if it solves a problem, even if its theoretical underpinnings are contested.

An **ideal verfifer** will try to:
* Integrate multiple forms of evidence and modes of understanding. For instance, when evaluating a historical claim, they should consider both empirical evidence (archaeological findings, primary documents) and interpretive analysis (cultural context, comparative studies).
* Acknowledge the strengths and limitations of different verification methods. Some questions are better suited to positivist approaches (measuring physical phenomena), while others require interpretive frameworks (understanding social movements).
* Consider practical implications while maintaining theoretical rigor. Following the pragmatist tradition, verification should balance abstract truth claims with real-world applications.
* Recognize that verification standards may vary by domain. What counts as verification in physics may differ from verification in anthropology or ethics.

## Correspondence vs. Coherence Theories:
* **Correspondence** (Aristotle, Bertrand Russell):
    * Truth aligns with objective reality. In subjective domains, this raises questions: What "reality" does a poem or ethical claim correspond to?
    * Limitation: Falters when reality is socially constructed (e.g., religion).

* **Coherence** (Hegel, Brand Blanshard):
    * Truth depends on internal consistency within a system of beliefs. For example, a legal argument is verified if it coheres with precedent and principles.
    * Critique: A coherent system can still be wrong (e.g., Ptolemaic astronomy).

* **Constructivism* (e.g., Foucault, Kuhn):
    * Truth and verification are shaped by power structures ("regimes of truth") or paradigms. In art, what counts as "good" is validated by institutions (museums, critics).

Example: The canonization of certain authors in literature reflects cultural power, not inherent quality.

An **ideal verifier** in this case will:

* Recognize that correspondence and coherence often complement rather than contradict each other:
    - Scientific theories need both empirical correspondence and theoretical coherence
    - Legal arguments require factual correspondence and precedential coherence
    - Complex systems benefit from both reality-matching and internal consistency

* Apply different verification standards contextually:
    - For empirical claims, prioritize correspondence with observable reality
    - For abstract systems (mathematics, logic), focus on internal coherence
    - For complex domains (ethics, law), balance both approaches

* Understand that verification often requires multiple levels of analysis:
    - First-order correspondence (does it match basic facts?)
    - Internal coherence (is it logically consistent?)
    - Systemic coherence (does it align with broader knowledge?)
    - Practical correspondence (does it work in application?)

* Be aware of potential verification traps:
    - A system can be internally coherent but disconnected from reality
    - Direct correspondence can miss important systemic relationships
    - Over-reliance on either approach can lead to blind spots

* Consider the role of pragmatic success:
    - Sometimes verification comes through practical effectiveness
    - A theory might work without perfect correspondence or coherence
    - Success in application can validate complex theoretical frameworks
