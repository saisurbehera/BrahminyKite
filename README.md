# Chil

A unified philosophical verification and distributed consensus framework named after the Chilika Chil (Brahminy Kite). Combines individual claim verification with distributed consensus protocols.

## Overview

Chil integrates six philosophical verification frameworks with modified Paxos consensus to create a dual-mode system:

- **Individual Mode**: Traditional claim verification using empirical, contextual, consistency, power dynamics, utility, and evolution frameworks
- **Consensus Mode**: Distributed verification across multiple nodes using philosophical Paxos protocol  
- **Hybrid Mode**: Both capabilities active simultaneously

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install chil package
pip install -e .

# Run individual verification
python scripts/run_verifier.py --mode individual

# Run consensus verification  
python scripts/run_verifier.py --mode consensus

# Run tests
python tests/run_tests.py

# Use in Python
python -c "import chil; v = chil.create_verifier(); print('Chil ready!')"
```

## Why the name ?
As many of you know, I have a deep love for birds. All my project names are inspired by birds observed near Chilika, Odisha.

This one draws inspiration from the à¬šà¬¿à¬²à¬¿à¬•à¬¾ à¬šà¬¿à¬² (Chilika Chil), the Brahminy Kiteâ€”a majestic hunter whose wings carve arcs across sunlit skies.

Just like them, I hope this project treads gracefully in its domain. ðŸŒ¿âœ¨
