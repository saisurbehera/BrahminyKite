# BrahminyKite

In this project, we will be covering verifiers and how to tune a lot of verifiers for RL tasks. This repo will be covering why we need these, how to make verifiers optimize over such large spaces, what are some tools they could use and how they can co=ordinate actions.


Why the name ?
As many of you know, I have a deep love for birds. All my project names are inspired by birds observed near Chilika, Odisha.

This one draws inspiration from the à¬šà¬¿à¬²à¬¿à¬•à¬¾ à¬šà¬¿à¬² (Chilika Chil), the Brahminy Kiteâ€”a majestic hunter whose wings carve arcs across sunlit skies.

Just like them, I hope this project treads gracefully in its domain. ðŸŒ¿âœ¨
